# Customer-and-Orders-Database
# üîç SQL Subqueries

Subqueries are essential for building complex queries by allowing one query to be nested within another.

# üìÅ Project Overview

This section showcases how to write and use **subqueries** in SQL to solve real-world database problems.

Subqueries are powerful tools used to:
- Compare results from different queries
- Filter data using conditions from another table
- Return single or multiple values inside conditions

This project is part of my learning and internship submission, aimed at demonstrating my understanding of database design concepts.

# üìå Tables:
- Customers
- Orders

# üßæ SQL Script

Creating the data
```
-- Create Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Create Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```
Inserting the data
```
-- Insert into Customers
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email) VALUES
(1, 'mayank', 'mayank234@gmail.com'),
(2, 'aman', 'patel764@gmail.com'),
(3, 'akhilesh', 'akhilesh876@gmail.com'),
(4, 'Sneha','sneha980@gmail.com');

-- Insert into Orders
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Amount) VALUES
(101, 1, '2025-06-01', 1500.00),
(102, 2, '2025-06-05', 2000.00),
(103, 3, '2025-06-03', 2500.00),
(104, 4, '2025-06-30', 3000.00);

```
# Subqueries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scalar Subqueries

A **scalar subquery** returns a **single value**, often used in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, or `HAVING` clauses.

```
SELECT Name
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING SUM(Amount) > (
        SELECT AVG(Amount) FROM Orders
    )
);
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery depends on a value from the outer query.

```
SELECT Name
FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID AND o.Amount < 2000
);
```



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery with **IN**

```
SELECT Name
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders
);
```



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery with **EXISTS**

```
SELECT Name
FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
);
```



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery with **=**
```
SELECT Name
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = (
    SELECT TOP 1 CustomerID
    FROM Orders
    ORDER BY Amount DESC
);
```
